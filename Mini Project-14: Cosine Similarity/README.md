# Cosine Similarity
- **Cosine similarity** is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.  
**Similarity = (A.B) / (||A||.||B||)** where A and B are vectors.
-   A.B is dot product of A and B: It is computed as sum of element-wise product of A and B.
-   ||A|| is L2 norm of A: It is computed as square root of the sum of squares of elements of the vector A.
##  **Applications**
1. **Document Similarity:** Cosine similarity helps determine the similarity between two documents, which is useful in plagiarism detection systems, text summarization, and document clustering.

2. **Music Recommendation:** By calculating the cosine similarity between user and song vectors based on musical features, cosine similarity aids in personalized music recommendations, matching users with similar music preferences.

3. **Image Search:** Cosine similarity enables image search engines to find visually similar images by comparing their feature vectors, allowing users to discover related images based on visual content.

4. **Customer Segmentation:** Using cosine similarity, customer behavior can be analyzed to group similar customers together for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations.

5. **Social Network Analysis:** By measuring the cosine similarity between user profiles or social network connections, cosine similarity helps identify communities and influencers in social networks.
